* BUGS *
********
- Right click stuff:
[02:55] Digital_: oh, there's also a conflict when right clicking as .click() doesn't differentiate between the left and right button
[02:55] Digital_: as a result, the first right click, adds a block (dragging it will then remove)
[02:57] Digital_: and I think I mentioned this before but when left clicking, items sometimes get dragged causing is_clicking to never reset because mouseup isn't triggered
[02:58] Digital_: never happens with right clicking
[02:58] Digital_: it happens on the original tedige too
[03:01] Digital_: might be browser related
[03:01] Digital_: happens with firefox and chrome for me
[03:01] Digital_: but I can't reproduce it on opera
- Recall feature works unreliably. Try moving the playfield 4x right, 4x down, recall, 2 times left, recall.
