*TO DO*
*******
MAJOR FEATURES
- interface cleanup
- lock active piece (and transform it into a inactive piece)
- gif generation (use imagemagick)
- frame browser like Tage
- better width/height support. Redraw seed if there's a change in those parameters. Also make a "change" button for this property

MINOR FEATURES
- a button to switch the hold piece with the first next piece
- a button to shift the next pieces forward by one
- a mirror button that would mirror the field with the option to also mirror the colors of JL/SZ

TO EXPAND
- undo/redo: there's could be a *much* more powerful system than just saving the last frame. See photoshop for instance...

* BUGS *
********
- Right click stuff:
[02:55] Digital_: oh, there's also a conflict when right clicking as .click() doesn't differentiate between the left and right button
[02:55] Digital_: as a result, the first right click, adds a block (dragging it will then remove)
[02:57] Digital_: and I think I mentioned this before but when left clicking, items sometimes get dragged causing is_clicking to never reset because mouseup isn't triggered
[02:58] Digital_: never happens with right clicking
[02:58] Digital_: it happens on the original tedige too
[03:01] Digital_: might be browser related
[03:01] Digital_: happens with firefox and chrome for me
[03:01] Digital_: but I can't reproduce it on opera
- wtf happens: paint an area with inactive pice, paint an active piece of the same type
