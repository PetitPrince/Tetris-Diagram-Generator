*TO DO*
*******
MAJOR FEATURES
- interface cleanup
- gif generation (use imagemagick)
- frame browser like Tage
- command display (what is pressed on each frame) + command decoration (so a possible combo would be arrow + CCW for instance)
	-> clearer DAS indicator ?
- animation ?
	-> each frame has a var that stores how long the frame must be displayed.
- nullpo map integration

MINOR FEATURES
- a button to switch the hold piece with the first next piece
- change colored garbage to gray garbage ?
- a button to shift the next pieces forward by one (done)
	-> currently now impractical
- a mirror button that would mirror the field with the option to also mirror the colors of JL/SZ

oh another thing, for the dropdowns, the reason I had blank values in there before is because the wiki defaults to something if you choose not to enter in any parameters
[15:57] Digital_:
so it doesn't force you to choose srs, border color, etc.
[15:59] Digital_:
it simplfies syntax especially if the diagram is not rotation specific
[16:02] PetitPrince:
aah ok
[16:04] PetitPrince:
maybe we should add a blank rotation system then ?
[16:04] Digital_:
default it to an existing rotation system perhaps?
[16:05] PetitPrince:
good idea

[22:51] Digital_:
pp, what do you think about implementing a tetromino sequence generator in tedige?
[22:51] PetitPrince:
i though of that
[22:51] PetitPrince:
that should be fun
[22:52] Edo joined the chat room.
[22:52] Digital_:
we can have a button that sets the next boxes
[22:52] Digital_:
and advances it or something
[22:52] PetitPrince:
i though of a bigger buffer for next piece
[22:53] PetitPrince:
currently we only have 3 piece (and see 3 $9
[22:53] PetitPrince:
we could set a bigger reservoir
[22:54] PetitPrince:
and have a lock+next piece button
[22:56] Digital_:
yeah
[22:57] PetitPrince:
textarea + string  for the piece sequuence?
[22:58] Digital_:
ooh, brilliant, I didn't think of it like that
[22:59] Digital_:
we could then have an external tool to spit out a sequence
[22:59] Digital_:
and import it into tedige that way

TO EXPAND
- undo/redo: there's could be a *much* more powerful system than just saving the last frame. See photoshop for instance...

* BUGS *

- Right click stuff:
[02:55] Digital_: oh, there's also a conflict when right clicking as .click() doesn't differentiate between the left and right button
[02:55] Digital_: as a result, the first right click, adds a block (dragging it will then remove)
[02:57] Digital_: and I think I mentioned this before but when left clicking, items sometimes get dragged causing is_clicking to never reset because mouseup isn't triggered
[02:58] Digital_: never happens with right clicking
[02:58] Digital_: it happens on the original tedige too
[03:01] Digital_: might be browser related
[03:01] Digital_: happens with firefox and chrome for me
[03:01] Digital_: but I can't reproduce it on opera
