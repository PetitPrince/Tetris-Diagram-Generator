*TO DO*
*******
MAJOR FEATURES
- interface cleanup
- gif generation (use imagemagick)
- frame browser like Tage
- better width/height support. Redraw seed if there's a change in those parameters. Also make a "change" button for this property
	-> $('#diagram').html(''); doesn't work. Workaround: make a larger table (40X40 ?), make clever use of display:none;
MINOR FEATURES
- a button to switch the hold piece with the first next piece
- change colored garbage to gray garbage ?
- a button to shift the next pieces forward by one (done)
	-> currently now impractical
- a mirror button that would mirror the field with the option to also mirror the colors of JL/SZ

PetitPrince: oh man, that undo feature is so freaking useful
[15:39] Digital_:
especially if you clear lines by accident XD
[15:41] Digital_:
just now, I noticed something that would be really useful
[15:42] Digital_:
keyboard shortcuts to switch to the block you want to paint with
[15:43] Digital_:
it's painfully slow for me to move my mouse back and forth for the busier diagrams
[15:57] Digital_:
oh another thing, for the dropdowns, the reason I had blank values in there before is because the wiki defaults to something if you choose not to enter in any parameters
[15:57] Digital_:
so it doesn't force you to choose srs, border color, etc.
[15:59] Digital_:
it simplfies syntax especially if the diagram is not rotation specific
[16:02] PetitPrince:
aah ok
[16:04] PetitPrince:
maybe we should add a blank rotation system then ?
[16:04] Digital_:
default it to an existing rotation system perhaps?
[16:05] PetitPrince:
good idea
oh, another usability idea
[16:06] Digital_:
maybe it's because I'm used to fumen but it was nice being able to hit the next arrow on the last frame to create a new frame automatically
[16:07] PetitPrince:
that very simple to implement
[16:07] Digital_:
yeah
[16:07] Digital_:
just lock the active piece, make a copy, and clear lines
[16:08] PetitPrince:
what if you wanted a line to be filled or a piece to be still active ?
[16:09] Digital_:
I figured the former will be used more often
[16:09] Digital_:
the latter can still be done manually
[16:09] PetitPrince:
true
[16:10] PetitPrince:
so next arrow : new processed frame and shift next arrow: new blank frame ?
[16:11] Digital_:
is the shift next, the double arrow?
[16:12] PetitPrince:
?
[16:13] PetitPrince:
oh
[16:13] PetitPrince:
i though you meant the arrows on keyboard
-what I had in mind was something like ctrl+s selects the s tetromino or something like that
-i don't know if it's a crypto memory but i also remember thinking about pressing [1-9] to get the good tetramino
[02:10] PetitPrince:
pressing the number several time would iterate each row

TO EXPAND
- undo/redo: there's could be a *much* more powerful system than just saving the last frame. See photoshop for instance...

* BUGS *
********
- Right click stuff:
[02:55] Digital_: oh, there's also a conflict when right clicking as .click() doesn't differentiate between the left and right button
[02:55] Digital_: as a result, the first right click, adds a block (dragging it will then remove)
[02:57] Digital_: and I think I mentioned this before but when left clicking, items sometimes get dragged causing is_clicking to never reset because mouseup isn't triggered
[02:58] Digital_: never happens with right clicking
[02:58] Digital_: it happens on the original tedige too
[03:01] Digital_: might be browser related
[03:01] Digital_: happens with firefox and chrome for me
[03:01] Digital_: but I can't reproduce it on opera
